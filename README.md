# Building aspam classifier--udacity

## Introduction

<P>Spam detection</p> is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built-in and automatically classify such mail as 'Junk Mail'.

## In this project
we will be using the Naive Bayes algorithm to create a model that can classify dataset SMS messages as spam or not spam, based on the training we give to the model. It is important to have some level of intuition as to what a spammy text message might look like. 


## Project Description:

    Step 0: Introduction to the Naive Bayes Theorem
    Step 1.1: Understanding our dataset
    Step 1.2: Data Preprocessing
    Step 2.1: Bag of Words (BoW)
    Step 2.2: Implementing BoW from scratch
    Step 2.3: Implementing Bag of Words in scikit-learn
    Step 3.1: Training and testing sets
    Step 3.2: Applying Bag of Words processing to our dataset.
    Step 4.1: Bayes Theorem implementation from scratch
    Step 4.2: Naive Bayes implementation from scratch
    Step 5: Naive Bayes implementation using scikit-learn
    Step 6: Evaluating our model
    Step 7: Conclusion
